;; This book defines two main functions, each supporting one type of rewrite
;; rule usage in GL.  Each returns a list of rules applicable to a given
;; function symbol. One lists branch merge rules where the function is the
;; leading symbol of the then branch of an IF on the LHS, given a list of all
;; runes to be allowed as branch merge rules; the other lists rules where the
;; function is the leading symbol, given a table mapping function names to
;; allowed rewrite rule runes.  Both are memoized (though in different ways)
;; and should give good performance: the branch-merge function computes a full
;; table of branch merge rules initially and memoizes that table, then does
;; constant-time lookups in it; the standard rewriting function computes a list
;; for each function symbol one at a time, memoizing the results per-function.
